# A Note on Last Names
At this point, it has become fashionable to use last names as a clan moniker and not a patrilineal/matrilineal line, and 'adoption' is extremely common. Most of the time, the person marrying 'upwards' (in terms of status) will adopt the last name of the higher-status person.

# What's going on?
## Background
Ann had an unhappy childhood; the family exerted enormous pressure to succeed. She married acceptably (and young), but her marraige was as unhappy as her childhood. She had two children, one by her husband and the other by another man. The parentage was impossible to conceal, due to genetic testing, so she did not try. She was forced to put up the second for a blind adoption - done secretly and anonymously, so as to avoid inheritance issues.

She kept the records, though, and hid them out in the desert, carefully memorizing the coordinates. She checked on them twice. The first time, she found, after three days of careful searching, reburying them with an iron bar to help in their detection. The second time, in a fit of paranoia, she dug it back up and pulled out the iron, leaving the plastic case and rolled documents hidden again beneath the surface.

Her husband and remaining daughter were victims of the 2051 LK Train Derailment. She left her corporate position and spent the time hiding, doing charity work and attempting to live a humble life. She adopted some children, became a teacher, and lived as best she could.

Now somebody has arisen who claims to be her secret son; whose DNA is of hers and her old fling's; who threatens to bring suit against her and her family. In all reasonable considerations, his claim is strong and plausible, and while there are no laws against anonymous adoption, it is not something that a good person does.

The only issue is that she is confident that this is impossible, as her son is dead. She checked, discreetly, after she pulled out the iron bar, and discovered to her shock and horror that he'd signed up for the navy and died in a burning wreck of Taiwan. She confirmed it by public records. It all checked out.

So who is this imposter? Laura believes it to be a Hayter family plot; Kin believes that Tor is backing him. Ann doesn't know whether or not this is true, but she does know that buried with the documents is a full sequence, and that this sequence almost certainly cannot match. So she drives to Reno in secret with her guardian dog, War, in hopes of resolving this issue.

## Plot
Ann is coming, but miscalculated her timing. On top of that, she's been pulled over and cited repeatedly for unsafe driving (any manual driving is viewed with extreme suspicion) further delaying her. She won't arrive until 7:15 in the evening, far after Jekusheke and Ebiaishe arrive.

After Ebiaishe and Jekusheke talk, two men approach, Silas (wide) and Arturius, aka Arthur (thin). They're sent by Landers (who fabricated the claim) to try and get info from Jekusheke on where the documents are. The decision point here is to talk to them (and they'll stay as long as you talk) or not (and they'll leave peacably).

When they leave, Ebiaishe has the chance to stalk them, or to stay indoors and discuss. If she stalks, she does a stakeout; if she doesn't, Ebiaishe and Jekusheke have some real drama times.

Ma Tiger arrives and is ambushed; Ebiaishe if staking out intervenes; otherwise you have the opportunity to respond to the situation. If you don't, you get put on the Ann Kidnapped path.

If you do respond, the branches converge, you save Ann. She explains that she's looking for proof of parentage out in the desert. You all go into the desert & search for it & camp out.

You set watches; whoever doesn't watch has dreams. Then you're ambushed. There's a scuffle. If you manage to fend off the ambush, you end up eventually finding the thing.

Then Ann ruminates about life, and reconciles, and the game ends, I guess.
